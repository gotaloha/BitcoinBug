I then set the height and width, with minimum dimensions added since I also want the app to be resizable. I don't want to display a title at the top of the app, and I want the background to be see-through. I want to have access to Node in my app, and I don't want Dev Tools open (this is toggled when in development/production).\n\nMore options are available but have not been added here."
